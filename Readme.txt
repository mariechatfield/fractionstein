Dr. Fractionstein's Laboratory is a fraction game for fourth and fifth graders.

Using Dr. Fractionstein's Laboratory, students should demonstrate the following
skills:
- Add fractions of like denominators
- Add fractions of unlike denominators
- Find the least common denominator of a pair of fractions
- Convert between different scales of fractions

Students are asked to help make a monster by combining the correct measurements
of potions. There are four different monsters that students can make, which
represent four levels of difficulty (from having to complete 4 to 10 fractions
to win the game). If a student guesses incorrectly twice, the potions explode
and he or she must start over. Upon successful completion of the designated
number of fractions in the level, he or she is presented with a drawing of the
monster.

Although the fractions in each level have a fixed denominator, the numerator and
possible choices are randomly generated so that each game is unique. All
fractions in Dr. Fractionstein’s Laboratory are proper. There may be more than
one correct answer; all that matters is that the student chooses a combination
of fractions that sums to the prompt fraction. Finally, all fractions are
represented in their simplified forms so students may have to scale prompt and
answer fractions to find the correct answer (i.e. if a prompt fraction is ½,
the correct combination may be ⅓ and ⅙).

Dr. Fractionstein’s Laboratory encourages students to improve their fraction and
critical thinking skills in a novel way, with colorful graphics and silly
potion names to retain attention and stimulate students’ imagination. Later
versions of the game may introduce more options to fine-tune the difficulty
level, as well as pictorial representations, improper fractions, and fraction
subtraction/multiplication/division.
